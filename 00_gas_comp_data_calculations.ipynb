    "#### Mean Calculations\n",
    "Measurement station (abbreviated in code as 'ms') provided data for two taps that fed into the filling location. As a conservative estimate and to account for latency in gas refill system (ie if gas is stored onsite for several days prior to use), we calculate a five-day average for mean gas composition. First, we calculate a daily average across the two taps. Next, we average the daily value across five days, inclusive of the refill date as the final day. Thus, for a gas refill on October 5th, we average gas composition from October 1st through October 5th.\n",

    "The Stanford team collected one or two gas samples from each truck refill. Samples were collected using canisters provided by Eurofins AirToxics laboratory in Fulsom (CA), where laboratory compositional analysis was conducted. We excluded results where canisters arrived at the laboratory with vacuum level exceeding 15 inches of mercury. Where multiple samples were available, we take the average of the two. Where samples were missing, we take the average of the samples taken on immediately before and after the missing sample dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eurofins AirToxics Laboratory used Modified ASTM D-1945 to analyze samples using a gas chromatograph with two detectors, a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Quantification was conducted on the following: oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, ethane, ethene, acetylene, propane, isobutane, butane, neopentane, isopoentane, pentane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the report provided by Eurofins Air Toxins Laboratory, the sum of the individual constituents of the gas sample provided was greater than 100%. Additionally, several samples included values for percent methane which were 100%, which does not align with typical values observed for compressed natural gas. Furthermore, percent recovery for quality control standards run with experimental samples ranged from 95% to 101%, potentially indicative of variability associated with sample loss during measurement.\n",

    "Eurofins AirToxics uses samples of known composition as quality control standards, and measures the percent recovery. Samples at Stanford were analyzed from October 28th, 2022 through December 9th, 2022. Eurofins provided quality control data for Q4 of 2022, which includes all standards analyzed from November 21, 2022 through February 21, 2023. During this period, the 95% confidence interval for methane percent recovery was 92% to 101%, corresponding to a 2-sigma value of 4.5%.\n",
