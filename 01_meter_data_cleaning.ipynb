    "Stanford metering data, cleaned according to data processing pipeline. Includes 30-s, 60-s, and 90-s average flow rates, percent methane, and whole gas measurements. Each measurement is provided for the three different timestamp metrics: Stanford timestamps, as observed from the field; operator reported timestamps; and FlightRadar timestamps.\n",

    "## Script objective:\n",
    "- Load gas flow data for each flight day and assign methane mole fraction based on KM data\n",
    "- Make \"operator_meter\" datasets for each method of using timestamp. Use whole-gas measurements from cleaned meter data, assign appropriate methane mole fraction, and calculate average and standard deviation of the release rate in kgh CH4 for each airplane overpass"

    "### Make operator meter files\n",
    "Operator meter files (saved in 02_meter_data > operator_meter_data) are meter files that used as input for creating the operator overpass summary dataframe (03_results > overpass_summary), which in turn is the input for all major analysis of airplane performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator meter files have the following columns:\n",
    "- *datetime_utc*: datetime in UTC timezone, dtype is datetime object\n",
    "- *overpass_id*: matches PerformerExperimentID in the operator report\n",
    "- *phase_iii*: indicates if we provided the operator with the flow rate for this overpass in Phase III, with 1 meaning we gave the overpass and 0 meaning we did not\n",
    "- *meter*: indicates which meter was used for measurement (bc = small Coriolis meter, mc = medium Coriolis meter, pc = large Coriolis meter)\n",
    "- *qc_su_discard*: 0 if Stanford did NOT discard, 1 if Stanford QC does indicate this should be discarded, using lax criteria. Lax criteria is the standard for all analysis, we compare to strict in 07_qc_comparison.ipynb\n",
    "- *qc_su_discard_strict*: indicates if Stanford would discard (1) with strict criteria, or keep (0) with strict criteria\n",
    "- *altitude_feet*: flight altitude in feet, averaged for 60 seconds prior to the plane being directly over the release point. (Note: units in 02_meter_data > summary_files are tracking data, and are in the units reported by the tracking system. This is feet for FlightTracker and meters for Kairos' reporting system, both in units above sea level. The script clean_meter_column_names converts these to feet above ground level)\n",
    "- *methane_fraction_km*: fraction methane using gas composition provided by Kinder Morgan. Suffix initials can also be \"su_raw\" and \"su_normalized\" if those methane mole fraction values are used in analysis\n",
    "- *methane_fraction_km_sigma*: this is the standard deviation value (1-sigma) associated with gas compositional analysis, associated with the methane_fraction_km value provided\n",
    "- *kgh_gas_60_mean*: average whole gas flow rate for the 60 seconds preceding the overpass time. Number will change with averaging period\n",
    "- *kgh_gas_60_std*: standard deviation of gas calculated over the 60 seconds preceding the overpass timestamp\n",
    "- *kgh_ch4_60_mean_km*: average methane flow rate averaged over 60 seconds, using Kinder Morgan gas composition\n",
    "- *kgh_ch4_60_std_km*: standard deviation of the methane flow rate, over 60 seconds, using Kinder Morgan gas composition data\n",
