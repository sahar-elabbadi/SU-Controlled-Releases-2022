    "Stanford metering data, cleaned according to data processing pipeline. Includes 30-s, 60-s, and 90-s average flow rates, percent methane, and whole gas measurements. Each measurement is provided for the three different timestamp metrics: Stanford timestamps, as observed from the field; operator reported timestamps; and FlightRadar timestamps.\n",

    "## Script objective:\n",
    "- Load gas flow data for each flight day and assign methane mole fraction based on KM data\n",
    "- Make \"operator_meter\" datasets for each method of using timestamp. Use whole-gas measurements from cleaned meter data, assign appropriate methane mole fraction, and calculate average and standard deviation of the release rate in kgh CH4 for each airplane overpass"
