    "    - Kairos: 1 - 349, incrementing by 1 with each overpass\n",
    "    - GHGSat: First digits are the date, month, time (apparently in UTC), followed by info on line number and frame number, then incrementally increasing numbers from 1 - 192\n",
    "    - Carbon Mapper: 1 - 121, incrementing by 1 with each overpass\n",
