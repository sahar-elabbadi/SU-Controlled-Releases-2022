    "### Notes\n",
    "- Currently, this calls and cleans data for Stage 1 for Carbon Mapper, GHGSat, and Kairos LS23 pod\n",
    "- Takes operator reports as input from 00_raw_data. No changes were made to operator reported results\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Do:\n",
    "- Change code so that cleaning each data file is a function that takes a the spreadsheet as input. This way, I can run the function on Stage 1, 2, 3 data and not copy huge chunks of code with only minor changes to syntax along the way\n",
    "- Consider: do I want to combine all the output clean data into one massive dataframe, which I then filter as needed downstream?\n",
    "- Need to add Scientific Aviation"
